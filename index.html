            Who Am I?
        </h2>
        <p> Hello, my name is</p> <p style="color:red;">Michelle Martinez!</p>
            
            <p> I am currently a student at <i>New York City College of Technology</i> . So far my college experience has been just alright. I was hoping for more resources at this school in comparison to my last school the <i>Borough of Manhattan Community College</i>. In <i>BMCC</i> , my major was Digital Communications and Multimedia, which then transferred to my current major Communications Design. I do like this major due to the flexibility of learning different areas of expertise.</p>

<h3>
What Does The Future Hold?

</h3>

<p>
    With my Bachelors Degree I am hoping to land a job somewhere in the Fashion World as an editorial Photographer. I have been adding to my portfolio and my skill set to prepare myself for an opportunity. In addition, I would also like to join a team in Public Relations, I believe with my internship experience in media agencies and the development brands through social media and business development, I would be a great addition to a agency.

<h4> Now What?

    To move foward I believe this quote from brainyquote website says it best:</p>

<br>
<p> Therefore, may we all embrace change.</p>
